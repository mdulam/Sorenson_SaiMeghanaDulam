C# coding assignment for Software Engineer position with Sorenson Communications

The requirements are as follows:

1: Keep the code as simple as possible and in a single source file.  
2: Create a Shape base class with GetArea() and GetName() methods.  
3: Create a Square class derived from Shape with a default side length of 2.  
4: Create a Circle class derived from Shape with a default radius of 2.  
5: The GetArea() method should return the area for the shape.  
6: The GetName() method should return the name of the shape (“Square” or “Circle”).  
7: Create a collection of Shapes and insert one of each type of Shape in the collection.  
8: Use a loop to print the name and area for each shape.  

Steps Involved:  

Step 1: I have created an Interface called Shape initially which has the methods GetArea() and GetName().  
Step 2: I have created a class Square which implements the interface Shape.  
Step 3: I have created a class Circle which implements the interface Shape.  
Step 4: Created a driver class(name: program) which creates and initializes the Shape objects(Square, Circle) and adds them to a Collection(List).  
Step 5: Display required results.
